==================================

Introduction
---------------------
This is the main repository for the software related to Maia, a new evented and agent-oriented architecture. The server uses websockets for communication between the different nodes, as it is focused on providing lightweight clients in any platform, including web browsers.

*This application is under heavy development*, so try it and get in contact with us so we can improve it.

There are several example clients for different languages in our repositories, and this server also offers a javascript client in the browser that serves as a logger and tester.

Installation instructions
------------------------------
Our aim is to deploy the cleanest code possible, and make it available through the main distribution channels for each programming language (pip, npm...)

* For the server side: You can clone this repository directly, or simply install via [npm](https://npmjs.org/).
* For the clients: Follow the specific instructions in the client folder.
