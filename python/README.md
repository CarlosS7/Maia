Introduction

*This application is under heavy development*, so try it and get in contact with us so we can improve it.

There are other example clients for different languages in our repositories, and a server that also offers a javascript client in the browser that can be used as a logger and tester.

Installation instructions

You are encouraged to run this client in a virtualenv. The requirements can be installed with pip.
